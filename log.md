#Day 1 of 100 Days Of Code - 2019

### Day 1: July 21st (Sunday)

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on my group project Capstone coding camp. I spent around an hour on that and around 2-3 hours looking at different security topics and coding a linked list on repl.

**Thoughts**: The work today went alright just hope to get the project landing page done soon.

**Link(s) to work**: https://github.com/camscoderepo/capstone-coding-camp is my fork but we have no link to a project site yet.
