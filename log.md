#Day 1 of 100 Days Of Code - 2019

### Day 1: July 21st (Sunday)

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on my group project Capstone coding camp. I spent around an hour on that and around 2-3 hours looking at different security topics and coding a linked list on repl.

**Thoughts**: The work today went alright just hope to get the project landing page done soon.

**Link(s) to work**: https://github.com/camscoderepo/capstone-coding-camp is my fork but we have no link to a project site yet.

### Day 2: July 21st (Monday)

**Today's Progress**: Today I spent a couple on my data structure course through Andrei. Got to almost 50% complete so good progress is being made.
**Thoughts**: Not much got done today.

### Day 3: July 22nd (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked for maybe about an hour on my project but didn't get much done. I am struggling with just some flexbox stuff but hopefully will have the last component done soon.

**Thoughts**: I really don't feel like doing much lately but want to keep committed to at least the hour each day.

### Day 4: July 23rd (Wednesday)

**Today's Progress**: Today I focused much more on job searching and didn't really code at all. I did spend the whole day job searching and looking into different coding programs though.

**Thoughts**: Not really any coding done today but did get a lot of applications turned in.
