#Day 1 of 100 Days Of Code - 2019

### Day 1: July 21st (Sunday)

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on my group project Capstone coding camp. I spent around an hour on that and around 2-3 hours looking at different security topics and coding a linked list on repl.

**Thoughts**: The work today went alright just hope to get the project landing page done soon.

**Link(s) to work**: https://github.com/camscoderepo/capstone-coding-camp is my fork but we have no link to a project site yet.

### Day 2: July 22nd (Monday)

**Today's Progress**: Today I spent a couple on my data structure course through Andrei. Got to almost 50% complete so good progress is being made.
**Thoughts**: Not much got done today.

### Day 3: July 23rd (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked for maybe about an hour on my project but didn't get much done. I am struggling with just some flexbox stuff but hopefully will have the last component done soon.

**Thoughts**: I really don't feel like doing much lately but want to keep committed to at least the hour each day.

### Day 4: July 24th (Wednesday)

**Today's Progress**: Today I focused much more on job searching and didn't really code at all. I did spend the whole day job searching and looking into different coding programs though.

**Thoughts**: Not really any coding done today but did get a lot of applications turned in.

### Day 5: July 25th (Thursday)

**Today's Progress**: Today was actually a very productive day, I finished the mission component on the landing page of my group project so that is done now. Hopefully things continue to be this productive.

**Thoughts**: Coded for a few hours and did some job searching and actually may have gotten somewhere finally with that.

### Day 6: July 26th (Friday)

**Today's Progress**: Today has been an all day long affair, in fact I am still doing stuff and will be well into the night. I am trying to get a few demo AWS projects done to show a potential employer. So far just have an example almost done but its my first day and I have about a week. It's like my own solo Hackathon!

**Thoughts**: Setting up things on AWS has been a lot of reading documentation haven't done much coding other than pasting it and naming some variables.

### Day 7: July 27th (Saturday)

**Today's Progress**: Started my second aws project, the first one on my own. This one will be built using the serverless framework and is a coding evaluator. Hopefully I will be finished soon.

**Thoughts**: This project has been the craziest project and the internet as the only resource makes it incredibly hard. I also don't have a lot of time to finish but hopefully we can get it done.

### Day 8: July 28th (Sunday)

**Today's Progress**: Kept working on my second project and got a lot done on it but also got very stuck. That's one thing that sucks about serverless, since it's so new there isn't much help anywhere when things go wrong. I have to just keep working.

**Thoughts**: This has been a challenging start for sure but hopefully I get through it.

### Day 10: July 30th (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**: Bought an aws course to understand the things that seem to be already challenging to understand. It has helped some so far but I will have to see how much it helps in the long run. Started project in the course to code alongside my aws project.

**Thoughts**: This is hard to keep doing, im going to have to slow down some soon or else I will get burnt out.

### Day 11: July 31st (Wednesday)

**Today's Progress**: Aws proves to keep throwing challenges my way and I am starting to feel defeated, at least for the moment. I have worked through many errors but there is still so much to understand and learn that I keep screwing really simple things up.

**Thoughts**: I may have to come up with a simpler project if I can't figure out how to progress with my code evaluator.

### Day 12: August 1st (Thursday)

**Today's Progress**: Didn't code much today, just tried working through bugs without any success.

**Thoughts**: Spemething isn't clicking for me and this stuff isn't getting simpler. Will try again tomorrow.

### Day 13: August 2nd (Friday)

**Today's Progress**: Today was really challenging to get anything done. I honestly don't know if I worked for even an hour. Helped fix a bug in one of my group projects though.
**Thoughts**: Aws is still proving to have it's challenges but I have grown immensely in the last month alone so I just have to keep at it.
